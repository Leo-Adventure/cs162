Baizhou Zhang|444|30|He worked on 'user_threads', designed and implemented 'pthread_create', 'pthread_join' and 'pthread_exit'. Besides, he also helped me work on modifying 'exit' syscall, then we passed all the tests. Our cooperation was very perfect. Also, as for design document, we exchanged our ideas and got an almost perfect design doc, which is of great help for the future coding task.
Haopeng Chen|450|18|He made great progress in this project. I assigned him the 'alarm clock' part and he finished it very well, including designing and implementing. Besides, in the design documentation part, he finished concept check with Yixuan Yang. It turned out that they helped each other and did good job.
Yixuan Yang|437|12|Due to some accident of his family, he had to pay more attention on dealing with some issues. Besides, he felt depressed and miserable. Even so, he managed to finished all the tasks I assigned to him. He made great progress as well, since he is willing to talk with us and starts his part early. I think he worth praising and that he should keep working. (Please don't mention anything about his family, since he has dealt with it well and that he doesn't want to talk it anymore)
